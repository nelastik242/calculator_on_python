# calculator_on_python

This is my first project while learning python.
tell me what to add or how to improve so that my programming skills improve.

The logic of the program.
created the "calculator" function. The "while" loop is for the calculator to work indefinitely. "Try" to detect an error if the user entered something else instead of a number.Ð¡reated two variables for floating point numbers "one_number " and "two_number " and one variable for storing actions with these numbers "action".With the help of the "match" construction, I prescribed the logic of the calculator.
